'     A bimodal process which occurs in the Kuroshio, with no counterpart in the Gulf Stream, ',...

' the east of Shikoku. This meander deflects the main jet of the current more than 300 km ',...
' offshore. Many different control mechanisms have been suggested for the formation process of ',...
' this ``large meander,'' including downstream topographic control by the Izu-Ogasawara Ridge, ',...
' upstream transport fluctuations, and ENSO conditions. Although these factors may determine if ',...
' suitable conditions exist for the development of the large meander, the meander itself is ',...
' observed to be preceded by a small upstream ``trigger meander''.',...
'  ',...
'     Trigger meanders are brief offshore meanders of the Kuroshio that occur east of Kyushu and ',...
' south of Shikoku. Even when the large meander is absent, most trigger meanders do not initiate ',...
' a large meander; but occasionally one does.  H. Soloman investigated trigger meanders using ',...
' historical GEK data. They found that they were related to abrupt increases in current velocities ',...
' in the region of the Tokara Strait, south of Kyushu. These increases in velocity preceded the ',...
' formation of a meander by approximately one month.  While their study of trigger meanders was ',...
