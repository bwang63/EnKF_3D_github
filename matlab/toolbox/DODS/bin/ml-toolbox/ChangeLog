	* Test suite tools now implemented in browse.m.  Also added many

	* Changed matrix index order in getmultiurls.m and in dispmenu.m
	so that combining of matrices and plotting both work with the
	new loaddods (3.2.7).  Fixed bug giving incorrect metadata when
	"Get Data" is executed without prior "Get Details".  Tested in
	Matlab 6.1.  Removed bug in browse.m preventing startup of variables
	menu. Changed default font in listboxes to 'Lucida', as 'Helvetica'
        was not supported in a bold-italicized mode on my systam.

	so that it is a proper function and not a script.

	multiple selecting, and resizing to listbox as requested
	by beta-testers.  These features are only turned on for
	the listedit.  Broke handling of each figure in the GUI 
	(8 of them) into an independent routine.  Added a color
	chooser figure.

	* Two major changes to update function: first, getfunctions
	must now be EXPLICITLY included in the MANIFEST.  Second,
	a list of downloaded functions is maintained, and each
	function is downloaded only once even if listed multiple
	times in the MANIFEST (for example, a if it is a
	function used by several different datasets).
