The ml-toolbox uses the loaddods Matlab command line tool. This tool works
with both Matlab 5 and 6, which means that the ml-toolbox should work with
both those as well. However, when using the ml-toolbox with Matlab 6.x, you
must start Matlab using the -nojvm option. Without this option Matlab won't
be able to run the loaddods command line tool. We apologize for this
inconvenience; a future version of the ml-toolbox will address this issue.
