		Colour Maps		File: ~dunn/matlab/colour/Discussion
		~~~~~~~~~~~				Jeff Dunn    20/6/96


In June 96 I asked the matlab-users group for help in developing colour maps.
My thanks to all those who gave me advice, maps and software. Other people
indicated they also were interested in the topic. My conclusion now is that
there is no easy answer, no best set of colours, no ideal software. However,
some useful things have arisen out of this exercise.


Robin Petterd has produced a discussion of the use of colours in representing
oceanographic data. It can be found at

	 /home/petterd/WWW/colornotes/home.html


A subset of the colourmaps that have been donated can be found in 
/home/dunn/matlab/colour. These are in the form of pictures in cruddy gif
files and the actual RGB numbers in ASCII files. The maps presented in Robin's
"colournotes" can also the found there. An index to these maps and some 
software is given below.


Issues I have not resolved are:

- There is a difference between what is on your screen and what comes out of 
  a printer. You may have to use different colour maps depending on ultimate
  use

- The same applies when converting to a different graphics format, say gif.

- Matlab colorbar reportedly accesses the colormap differently to contour fill

- Taking a subset of only a few colours from a colourmap may or may not work
  well, depending on the original colourmap. In such cases colourmaps with a 
  constant "colour gradient" work best, rather than those which have "flat 
  spots" with little change in colour.

- Specific colourmaps have been requested, such as:
	- "traditional" oceanographic colours - eg blue-white-red for
	   temperature.

This subdirectory contains colour maps specified as RGB triplets in ASCII
files. For each such map there is also a gif image (which can be viewed with
NetScape or xv). Note that these are very low resolution gif images, and may
represent only a small fraction of the original colours. 

Code		Description/Author/Comments
----		---------------------------

Wide Hue Range - High intensity:
a	Blue-Red 	(Peter McIntosh "cm.m")
b 	  "		(Jim Mansbridge "xtemperature")
c	Rainbow    	(Jim Mansbridge "xrainbow")
d       		("jet" modified as suggested by Jackson Chong)
e	Blue-Red	(Lindsay Pender "lfpcm1")
f	Blue-Red	(Walker/Hunter "bcgyr" - specified as 7 colours with
			associated values)
g	Blue-Red - slightly less saturated colours and light grey in middle.
			Because the brightness is fairly uniform it doesn't
			attract attention to any one value, but is terrible
			in greyscale.	(Jeff Dunn "anomaly")

Robin Petterd's maps (see his discussion on www):
h	Blue highlight
i	Midheight in red
j	Blue green white
k	Bright sat hue
l	green to red
m	purple to blue
n	purple to yellow
o	low ONLY

Special purpose colourmaps
p       Phil Morgan's bathymetry (blue to white). This has 8 colours, including
	the final white, with each colour repeated so that all depths in a 
	range (say 1000m) have the same colour. Phils assigned these colours
	to depth bands delimited by : 0 200 1000:1000:7000  

Other limited hue maps:
s	Blue-magenta-red	(Jim Mansbridge "xblue_mag_red")
t	bright purple-yellow	(Jeff Dunn - 2 complementary{?} colours in 
				style of some oceanographic atlases)
u	green-blue-purple     (Jeff Dunn - lousy colours but smooth brightness
			       ramp from dark to light - good for grey-scales)
v       red-blue-green-red	(Dunn - maybe for circular quantity (phase?)

Tools
~~~~~
colouredit
	A tcl script written by Robin Petterd to create colour maps. I found it
	useful for hunting for particular colours, by twiddling the R G B 
	sliders, and for experimenting with hue, saturation and brightness. By
	setting a max and min colour, a colourmap can be dumped, but it is only
	a linear interpolation of RGB between the max and min, and is dumped in
	HSV form (although this could easily be changed.) Another quirk of 
	colouredit is that it has some sort of inbuilt instability - and will
	frequently adjust the settings itself in competition with your attempts
	to adjust the settings.
 
 
interpcolormap.m
	Matlab function to interpolate from some RGB triples. Values can 
	optionally be assigned to each triple, to stretch the resulting map.
	Basically just drives interp1 in 'spline' or 'linear' modes. You may
	have to tinker with the input map to get the 'spline' mode to create
	a better (rather than a much worse) result.

			
/home/walker/src/sjwlib/colourtable.c
	This provides functions for building a colourmap and returning a 
	colour for a given value. Steve also has a range of other colour maps.


Other tools
~~~~~~~~~~~
xv	This is one of the products which has great potential, but I can't get
	it to do the job I want. You dial up colours in a wonderful way 
	in the colour editor, but the HSV and RGB dont seem to fully interact 
	(the one RGB setting will produce a range of colours depending on the 
	intensity function), and you can't dump the numbers making up a map.
