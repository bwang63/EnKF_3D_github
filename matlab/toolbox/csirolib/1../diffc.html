 DIFFC	    centered difference function.  
       If A is a vector [a(1) a(2) ... a(n)],
	then DIFFC(A) returns a vector of differences between
	<A HREF = "../1../elements.html">elements</A> [ ... a(i)-a(i-2) ... ].  

       If A is a matrix, the differences are calculated down each column:
	DIFF(A) = A(3:m,:) - A(1:m-2,:).

	DELX = DIFFC(A)   will be the centered difference in x of A
	DELY = DIFFC(A')' will be the centered difference in y of A
