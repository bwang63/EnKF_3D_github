 QUIVER2 Improved quiver to allow x,y specifications: superceded by <A HREF = "../1../quiver_ext.html">quiver_ext</A>
 
QUIVER2   1.1   92/04/14
	Modification to the standard QUIVER plot to allow specification
	of the x and y coordinates -- this enables a quiver plot to
	be drawn with meaningful axes, and in particluar to be overlaid
	(using HOLD ON) upon a CONTOUR plot.

	QUIVER2(Z) draws a graph that displays the angle and magnitude
	of the complex <A HREF = "../1../elements.html">elements</A> of Z as arrows emanating from equally
	spaced grid positions, one arrow per matrix element.

	QUIVER2(X,Y) is equivalent to QUIVER2(X+i*Y).  It displays the
	quiver plot for the angles and magnitudes of the <A HREF = "../1../elements.html">elements</A> of
	matrices X and Y.

	QUIVER2(Z,'S') and QUIVER2(X,Y,'S') use line style 'S' where
	'S' is any legal linetype as described under the PLOT command.

	QUIVER2(Z,'S',XCOORD,YCOORD) and QUIVER2(X,Y,'S',XCOORD,YCOORD) 
	use XCOORD and YCOORD as the axis scales.  For example, vectors
	giving the longitude and latitude coordinates respectively of
	points at which the X,Y data are defined

	See also QUIVER, GRADIENT, COMPASS, FEATHER, and ROSE.

	BUGS: Doesn't seem to like plotting subsets, 
	e.g. QUIVER2(U(Y,X),V(Y,X),XCOORD(X),YCOORD(Y))?
