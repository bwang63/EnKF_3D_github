 HDRLOAD Load data from an ASCII file containing a text header.
     [header, data] = HDRLOAD('filename.ext') reads a data file
     called 'filename.ext', which contains a text header.  There
     is no default extension; any extensions must be explicitly
     supplied.

     The first output, HEADER, is the header information, returned
     as a text array.
     The second output, DATA, is the data matrix.  This data matrix
     has the same dimensions as the data in the file, one row per
     line of ASCII data in the file.  If the data is not regularly
     spaced (i.e., each line of ASCII data does not contain the
     same number of points), the data is returned as a column
     vector.

     Limitations:  No line of the text header can begin with
     a number.  Only one header and data set will be read,
     and the header must come before the data.
