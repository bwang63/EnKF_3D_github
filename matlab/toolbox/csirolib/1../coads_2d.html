 coads_2d converts a 1-d COADS field to a 2-d one.
 The data stored on the COADS cd rom has only one dimension for the
 horizontal.  (This is a space saving device since land points are not
 recorded.)  Usually we want the data on a lat/lon grid and this
 function does the conversion.  While the 1-d field (vector) has 42164
 points the 2-d field is a 360*180 matrix.  The row <A HREF = "../1../elements.html">elements</A> are
 latitude (-89.5:89.5) and the column <A HREF = "../1../elements.html">elements</A> are longitude
 (0.5:359.5).  Information describing the mapping from 1-d to 2-d is in
 the file coads_grid.mat that was created by grid_mat.m.  All missing
 values have been converted to NaNs.

 There must be either 1,2 or 6 input fields.  If coads_index_1d, the
 second input variable, is not passed then it will be loaded from
 coads_grid.mat.  Typically this takes about half the time of the whole
 coads_2d call.  Thus if coads_2d.m is called in a loop it is much more
 efficient to load coads_grid.mat once outside the loop and then pass
 it.  If coads_index_1d is not of the expected length then it will be
 loaded separately.  Thus a loading can be forced by passing a simple
 scalar.  The 4 final input variables are the integers specifying the
 minimum and maximum indicies of the longitude and latitude vectors.
 Hence they partially correspond to hyperslab access which would have
 been available if there had been separate longitudinal and latitudinal
 directions in the netCDF files.  When only 1 or 2 input argument are
 given then the full, 180*360 matrix will be returned.

    input fields:
 field_1d: a 1-d COADS field as would be returned by a call to getcdf.
 coads_index_1d: The indices of all of the ocean points in the matrix
                 field_2d.
 ind_lon_min: The minimum index in the longitudinal direction.
 ind_lon_max: The maximum index in the longitudinal direction.
 ind_lat_min: The minimum index in the latitudinal direction.
 ind_lat_max: The maximum index in the latitudinal direction.

    output fields:
 field_2d: The same data as in the 1d field but as a matrix where the
           rows vary with latitude and the columns with longitude.
           Note that this is the usual order of storing geographical
           fields and requires the taking of a transpose.
 lon: A vector giving the longitudes corresponding to different columns
 lat: A vector giving the latitudes corresponding to different rows
