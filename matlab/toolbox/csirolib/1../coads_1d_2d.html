 coads_1d_2d converts a 1-d COADS field to a 2-d one.
 The data stored on the COADS cd rom has only one dimension for the
 horizontal.  (This is a space saving device since land points are not
 recorded.)  Usually we want the data on a lon/lat grid and this
 function does the conversion.  While the 1-d field (vector) has 42164
 points the 2-d field is a 360*180 matrix.  The row <A HREF = "../1../elements.html">elements</A> are
 longitude (0.5:359.5) and the column <A HREF = "../1../elements.html">elements</A> are latitude (-89.5:89.5).
 All missing values have been converted to NaNs.

 There must be either 1 or 5 input fields.  The 4 final input variables are
 the integers specifying the minimumn and maximum indices of the longitude
 and latitude vectors.  Hence they partially correspond to hyperslab access
 which would have been available if there had been separate longitudinal
 and latitudinal directions in the netCDF files.  When only 1 input
 argument is given then the full, 180*360 matrix will be returned.
    INPUT:
 field_1d: a 1-d COADS field as would be returned by a call to getnc.
 ind_lon_min: The minimum index in the longitudinal direction.
 ind_lon_max: The maximum index in the longitudinal direction.
 ind_lat_min: The minimum index in the latitudinal direction.
 ind_lat_max: The maximum index in the latitudinal direction.

    OUTPUT:
 field_2d: The same data as in the 1d field but as a matrix where the
           rows vary with longitude and the columns with latitude.
           Note that this is corresponds to the order that the values are
           stored in the original 1-d form and gives the quickest
           retrieval.
 lon: A vector giving the longitudes corresponding to different rows
 lat: A vector giving the latitudes corresponding to different columns

    EXAMPLE USAGE:

 file = '/CDROM/data/anomaly/netheat'; % cd-rom 2
 k = 10; % month 10
 netheat_init = getnc(file, 'clm', [k -1], [k -1]);  % get a vector
 [netheat, lon, lat] = coads_1d_2d(netheat_init);    % get the 2-d netheat
 [netheat_sub, lon_sub, lat_sub] = coads_1d_2d(netheat_init, 100, 180, 40, 80);
