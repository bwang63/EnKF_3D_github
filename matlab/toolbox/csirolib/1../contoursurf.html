  CONTOURSURF contouring over non-rectangular surface.
        This is an extension of contourc.
        CONTOURSURF calculates the contour matrix C for use by <A HREF = "../1../extcontour.html">EXTCONTOUR</A>
        to draw the actual contour plot.
        C = CONTOURSURF(Z) computes the contour matrix for a contour plot
        of matrix Z treating the values in Z as heights above a plane.
        C = CONTOURSURF(X,Y,Z), where X and Y are vectors, specifies the X- 
        and Y-axes for the contour computation. X and Y can also be matrices of 
        the same size as Z, in which case they specify a surface in an 
        identical manner as SURFACE.
        CONTOURSURF(Z,N) and CONTOURSURF(X,Y,Z,N) compute N contour lines, 
        overriding the default automatic value.
        CONTOURSURF(Z,V) and CONTOURSURF(X,Y,Z,V) compute LENGTH(V) contour 
        lines at the values specified in vector V.
  
        The contour matrix C is a two row matrix of contour lines. Each
        contiguous drawing segment contains the value of the contour, 
        the number of (x,y) drawing pairs, and the pairs themselves.  
        The segments are appended end-to-end as
  
            C = [level1 x1 x2 x3 ... level2 x2 x2 x3 ...;
                 pairs1 y1 y2 y3 ... pairs2 y2 y2 y3 ...]
