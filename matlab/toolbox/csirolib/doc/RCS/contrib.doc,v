SUBMITTING MFILES TO THE LIBRARY
===============================
Please write your mfiles according to the guide lines detailed below and
email your submissions to the matgrp with appropriate data files or the 
location of such files.  Your name will of course feature prominently in the
submissions list.



******************************************
*  WRITING MFILES FOR THE MATGRP LIBARY  *
******************************************


COMMENTS
========
When writing mfiles comments are delineated by a "%" character.  Anything 
following on such a line is treated as a comment.  The first block of
comments will be displayed whenever a "help mfilename" command is given
in MATLAB.  For example the mfile 'diff' (supplied with MATLAB) has an 
initial comment block (help display) followed by other comments such as the
authors name etc.  The comments concerning the author etc are not part of the 
help display since there is a line separating the two blocks.


-----------------------mfile diff.m-------------------------------------
function x = diff(x,k)
%DIFF   Difference function.  If X is a vector [x(1) x(2) ... x(n)],
%       then DIFF(X) returns a vector of differences between adjacent
%       elements [x(2)-x(1)  x(3)-x(2) ... x(n)-x(n-1)].  If X is a
%       matrix, the differences are calculated down each column:
%       DIFF(X) = X(2:n,:) - X(1:n-1,:).
%       DIFF(X,n) is the n'th difference function.

if nargin == 1
        k = 1;
end
for i=1:k
        [m,n] = size(x);
        if m == 1
                x = x(2:n) - x(1:n-1);
        else
                x = x(2:m,:) - x(1:m-1,:);
        end
end

REQUIRED INFO IN HELP DISPLAY
=============================
The help display of an mfile should include the following

1.  Show name of mfile and current release.version number.
       The notation used will be such that the first number indicates the
       release number (a major modification) and the second number is the 
       version number (a minor modification).  Thus MSDOS 3.2 and 3.3 are 
       minor modications whereas MSDOS 4.1 is a major upgrade.

2.  Description of mfile.

3.  List and describe all input/output arguments for the mfile.

4.  List of all routines that call each other.  I usually denote
       CALLEE: file1 file2  - current file calls (tells) file1 & file2 to do
                              some work for it (cf EMPLOYEE)
       CALLER: file3        - current file is called by (ordered) file3to do
                              some work for file3 (cf EMPLOYER)
       Often a self contained mfile will have
       CALLER: general purpose
       CALLEE: none

5.  Author and date of original version of mfile.

6.  References if appropriate.

7.  Examples of what to expect with some small demo data or how
    to call it if there are complex options of calling.


For very simple mfiles the comment style for 'diff' may be
adequate but usually all the above points should be noted and a good
example of style is shown in 'change.m' (a matgrp library mfile).
This style is not rigid.  You can develop your own BUT it should 
include all the required info as listed above.

 
INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION
======================
Should include references if possible.  Give variables meaningful names so
future debugging/improvement is easier.  Please add generous comments.
