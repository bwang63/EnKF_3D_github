WHO IS THIS FOR ?
==================
Anyone using MATLAB at the CSIRO Marine Labs, Hobart AUSTRALIA.  MATLAB is
currently installed on the Silicon Graphics Inc. mainframe known as "aqueous".
This guide is to help you become more productive by detailing how to use
the site-wide library of MATLAB routines written by other CSIRO users.


WHO IS THE MATGRP ANYWAY ?
==========================
The matgrp are experienced users who have decided to coordinate the development
of a site-wide library of MATLAB routines and administer bug reports, upgrades
and appropriate user documentation.  The driving force is the need to have
a common set of reliable routines that everyone can use with confidence.
This will increase productivity by users by avoiding "re-inventing the wheel" 
and is a more professional approach to software development (often a 
"software librarian" is employed to do this).  All contact with the matgrp 
should be by email to matgrp@@ml.csiro.au.


WHAT IS THE MATGRP LIBRARY
==========================
The matgrp library is the collection of MATLAB routines written in the MATLAB
language.  These routines are generally called mfiles (pronounced "m files") 
because the source files end in "*.m" just as FORTRAN code end in
"*.f" and C code in *.c.  All the mfiles are in your MATLAB path (by default).
Information on each routine is available via the usual "help commandname".


WHAT IS IN THE LIBRARY
======================
To get a listing of mfiles in the matgrp library type "lib" in MATLAB.


COPYRIGHT
=========
Routines in the matgrp library are donated by the authors for use ONLY at
the CSIRO Marine Labs.   DO NOT redistribute these routines without the
explicit permission of the author(s).  The author(s) name will always appear 
in the help display for each routine.



BUGS AND IMPROVEMENT
====================
Bug and improvement reports are always welcome.  These should be emailed to
the matgrp at the address matgrp@@ml.csiro.au and we shall fix the problem or
forward the info to the author(s).  Please do not send such reports to the
author(s) as only the matgrp has permission to replace routines in the matgrp 
library with updated versions. 

The authors have graciously provided all routines on a use "as is" basis and 
are not responsible for making updates at users requests.  However, many 
authors shall try to fix bugs etc as time permits.  If you fix a bug, please
notify the matgrp.

A note on reports.  Please record an actual session where you found the bug
in a particular routine so we know exactly what the problem is.
