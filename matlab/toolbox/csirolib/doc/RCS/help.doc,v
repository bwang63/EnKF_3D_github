BUGS AND IMPROVEMENT
====================
Bug and improvement reports are always welcome.  These should be emailed to
the matgrp at the address "matgrp" and we shall fix the problem or
forward the info to the author(s).  Please do not send such reports to the
author(s) as only the matgrp has permission to replace routines in the matgrp 
library with updated versions. 

The authors have graciously provided all routines on a use "as is" basis and 
are not responsible for making updates at users requests.  However, many 
authors shall try to fix bugs etc as time permits.  If you fix a bug, please
notify the matgrp.

A note on reports.  Please record an actual session where you found the bug
in a particular routine so we know exactly what the problem is.
