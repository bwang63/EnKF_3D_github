%FLAT_PCOLOR makes a pseudocolor plot of the entire matrix c using the
%same input arguments as pcolor but does so in the way that one would
%intuitively expect pcolor to work.  The problem with pcolor is that if
%shading is 'flat' or 'faceted' then the value of c(i,j) is used to draw
%a rectangle where the bottom left hand corner is at (x(j), y(i)) and
%the top right hand corner is at (x(j+1), y(i+1)).  Accordingly, the
%last row of c and last column of c are not used.  flat_pcolor uses x
%and y (which may be vectors or matrices) as the center of the rectangle
%and all rows and columns of c are used.  If only one argument is passed
%to flat_pcolor then this is assumed to be the matrix c and x and y are
%assumed to be the column and row indices.  The shading is set to
%'flat'.  Note that if shading is 'interp' then pcolor does a slow,
%bilinear interpolation between data points as would be expected but
%this means that a single NaN creates 4 blank spaces.  Since flat_pcolor
%shifts the x and y axes by half a grid length then you should not set
%shading('interp') after running flat_pcolor - use pcolor instead.  Note
%also that if x or y is a scalar then an axis going from 0 to 1 will be
%used.  This is useful for drawing a legend.
