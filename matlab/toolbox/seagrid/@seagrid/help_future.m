function help_future(self)

%    We intend for SeaGrid to be based solely on portable
% Matlab-5 m-files, independent of MathWorks toolboxes, and
% without any mex-files derived from lower-level languages.
% Presently, depending on the computer, three mex-files may
% be used, known as "mexrect", "mexsepeli", and "mexinside".
% The first can be replaced by "rect.m", and the third by
% "insidesafe.m".  The second can be inexactly mimicked by
% "fps.m", but an exact replacement will require additional
% work.
