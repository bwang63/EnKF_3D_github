function help_saving(self)
%
%    The current SeaGrid gridwork can be saved to a mat-file, using the
% "SeaGrid/Save" or "SeaGrid/Save As" menu item, then later retrieved
% with "Seagrid/Load" or "SeaGrid/Revert To Saved".  The grid and its
% associated data are stored in a Matlab "struct" named "s".  For an
% M-by-N grid, the grid-corners occupy an (M+1)-by-(N+1) array, while
% the gridded bathymetry and mask are stored as M-by-N arrays,
% corresponding to the grid-cell centers.  Such a saved file can
% be loaded back into SeaGrid.
%
%    To convert a SeaGrid file to Ecom or Scrum format, use the
% "seagrid2ecom" or "seagrid2scrum" routines.  See their respective
% "help" entries.
