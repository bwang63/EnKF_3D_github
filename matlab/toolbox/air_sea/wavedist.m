% WAVEDIST: estimates wind speed distortion due to surface waves.
% [U10,delU]=WAVEDIST(Ua,za,Hw) computes the true 10m wind speed U10
% using the wind speed Ua measured at the height za and measured wave 
% height Hw and the neutral log profile corrected for the effects of
% low-level distortion of the wind profile by surface waves following 
% Large, Morzel, and Crawford (1995), J. Phys. Ocean., 25, 2959-2971.

% INPUT:   Ua - wind speed  [m/s]
%          za - wind measurement height  [m] 
%          Hw - wave height  [m]
%
% OUTPUT:  U10 - true 10m wind speed  [m/s]
%          delU - difference between true and uncorrected  
%                  10m wind speed  [m/s]
