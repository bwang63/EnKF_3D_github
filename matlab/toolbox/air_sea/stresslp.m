% STRESSLP: computes neutral wind stress following Large and Pond (1981).
% tau = STRESSLP(sp,z,rhoa) computes the neutral wind stress given the wind
% speed at height z following Large and Pond (1981), J. Phys. Oceanog.,
% 11, 324-336. Air density is an optional input, otherwise assumed to
% be constant (1.22 kg/m^3).

%   INPUT:   sp    - wind speed             [m/s]
