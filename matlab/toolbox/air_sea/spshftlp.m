% SPSHFTTC: adjusts wind speed from z1 to z2 following Large&Pond (1981).
% sp2 = SPSHFTLP(sp1,z1,z2) shifts the wind speed sp1 measured at z1 to
% z2 using the neutral drag coefficient given the wind speed and air

%   INPUT:  sp1 - measured wind speed  [m/s]
%           z1 - measurement height [m]

%
%   OUTPUT: sp2 - predicted wind speed  [m/s]
%           ustar - friction velocity  [m/s]
