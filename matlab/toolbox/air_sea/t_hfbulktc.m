% T_HFBULKTC: a program to test hfbulktc.m using COARE test data
% T_HFBULKTC is a program to test hfbulktc.m using COARE test data
% (file test2_5b.dat).  NOTE: Make sure that you use the COARE 
% parameters located in the files as_consts.m and cool_skin.m when 
% conducting the test.
%
% VARIBLES:
%
%   ur     = wind speed [m/s] measured at height zr [m] 
%   Ta     = air temperature [C] measured at height zt [m]
%   rh     = relative humidity [%] measured at height zq [m]
%   Pa     = air pressure [mb]
%   Ts     = sea surface temperature [C]
%   sal    = salinity [psu (PSS-78)]
%   dlw    = downwelling (INTO water) longwave radiation [W/m^2]
%   dsw    = measured insolation [W/m^2]
%   nsw    = net shortwave radiation INTO the water [W/m^2]
%   rain   = rain rate  [mm/hr]
