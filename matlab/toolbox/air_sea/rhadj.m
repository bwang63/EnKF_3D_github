function rha = rhadj(rh,rhmax)
% RHADJ: rescales RH to have a maximum of 100%.
% RHADJ(rh,rhmax) rescales RH so that the maximum values do not
% exceed 100%. Assumes values between 93% and rhmax should be
% rescaled to 93 - 100% (the calibration curves of RH sensors usually
% become nonlinear above ~ 90%, and may peak above 100% in this range 
% above ~ 90% where their calibration becomes unstable.)
