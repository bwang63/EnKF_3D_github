function y=omegalmc(x)
% OMEGALMC: estimates wind log profile correction due to surface waves.
% y=OMEGALMC(x) computes the log profile correction function due to wind
% distortion associated with surface waves. Input is x=za/Hw, where za
% is the measurement height and Hw is the dominant surface wave height. 
% Functional form is simplified (analytic) version of empirical omega
% curves shown in Fig. 9b of Large, Morzel, and Crawford (1995), J. Phys.
% Oceanog., 25, 2959-2971, with the wave-induced roughness length xr=0.15. 
% Assumes x is a vector with all elements greater than zr.
