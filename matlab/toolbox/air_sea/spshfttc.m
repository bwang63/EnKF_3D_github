function [sp2,ustar]=spshfttc(sp1,z1,z2,Ta)
% SPSHFTTC: adjusts wind speed from z1 to z2 following Smith (1988).
% sp2 = SPSHFTTC(sp1,z1,z2,Ta) shifts the wind speed sp1 measured at z1 to
% z2 using the neutral drag coefficient given the wind speed and air
% temperature at height z following Smith (1988), J. Geophys. Res., 93,
% 311-326. Assumes z1 and z2 scalars. Ta may be a constant.

%   INPUT:  sp1 - measured wind speed [m/s]
%           z1 - measurement height [m]
%           z2 - desired height [m]
%           Ta - air temperature ([C] (optional)
%
%   OUTPUT: sp2 - predicted wind speed [m/s]
%           ustar - fiction velocity  [m/s]
