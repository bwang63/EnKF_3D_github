function [design,interact] = f_designMatrix(grps,trim)
% - create ANOVA design matrix using dummy variables
%
% USAGE: [design,interact] = f_designMatrix(grps,{trim});
%
% grps     = matrix of integers specifying factor levels or group membership;
%            (rows = observations, cols = factors)
% trim     = omitt last column from each term to avoid a singular matrix
%            (default = 1)
%
% design   = design matrix
% interact = interaction term(s); formatted as a cell array specifying 1st
%            & 2nd order interaction terms when 'GRPS' specifies 3 factors.

% -----Notes:-----
% ANOVA design matrices are used in Multiple Linear Regression, MANOVA,
% Canonical Variates Analysis, and Multiple Discriminant Analysis to specify
% group membership or factor levels. The number of columns in a design matrix
% is usually 1 less than the number of factor levels of each term. This is all
% you need to adequately represent those levels and, more importantly, allows
% you to take the inverse of (design'*design) which would otherwise be singular.
% TRIM is set as the default for this reason.
%
% For many applications the first column of the design matrix should be a row
% of 1's specifying the intercept term. This program does NOT add an intercept.
% Note that some (most?) programs automatically insert an intercept term in
% a design matrix, so check before using the output of this program.
