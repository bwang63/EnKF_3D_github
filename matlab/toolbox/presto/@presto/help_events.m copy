function theResult = help_events(self, varargin)%    Whenever a mouse event occurs on a "presto" object,% a callback reading "event theEventName" is executed,% where theEventName will be something like "ButtonDownFcn".% The "presto/event" method is responsible for translating% the event into an action.  Events from controls and menus% are converted to the name of the callback-object.  All% events are then converted to lower-case, deblanked, and% trimmed to consist only of alphanumeric characters.  The% result is given to a 'switch" ladder for final dispatching.%    When a new class is derived from "presto", it must% supply an "event" method of its own to override the% default "presto" behavior, as appropriate.  To invoke% the default behavior in a particular situation, call% "inherit(self, 'theEventName')".%    See "presto/event". % Copyright (C) 1999 Dr. Charles R.
