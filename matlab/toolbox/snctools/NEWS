SNCTOOLS 2.5.1 RELEASE
=======================================================================
This is the last stable release series before netcdf-4 functionality
begins to be folded into SNCTOOLS, which will start with the 2.9.x.
series.  Further 2.5.x releases will be bug-fixes only.

The big thing with this release is that a reduced subset of SNCTOOLS
can run (and tested) with java as the backend, instead of mexc.  If
you use windows, just need to read netCDF files (conversely, you don't
need to write netCDF files), and don't use the Netcdf Toolbox, then I
strongly recommend that you just use SNCTOOLS and don't bother with 
mexnc.  In this case, there is no longer any requirement for anything
in mexnc, including any of the auxilliary m-files.

The set of m-files that do not require mexnc are
	NC_ATTGET
	NC_VARGET
	NC_DUMP
	NC_INFO
	NC_DATATYPE_STRING
	NC_ISCOORDVAR
	NC_ISUNLIMITEDVAR
	NC_GETLAST
	NC_ISVAR
	NC_VARSIZE
	NC_GETVARINFO
	NC_GETBUFFER

NC_GETDIMINFO has been changed into a private function.

SNCTOOLS 2.4.0 RELEASE
=======================================================================
Check the ChangeLog for details on what's changed, but the user should 
be aware that some user code will probably break with this release.
If you get bitten by this, let me know and I'll try to work with you
to resolve the issue.
