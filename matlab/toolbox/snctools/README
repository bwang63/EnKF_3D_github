SNCTOOLS OVERVIEW
=======================================================================
All of SNCTOOLS will currently run on Matlab release R13 or higher,
but requires R14 if one wishes to use java as the backend.  See below
for more notes about that.  Don't bother trying with R12, you'll get
nowhere.

Of all the routines in this m-file collection, the most useful (in my
humble opinion) are as follows
	
	1. nc_varget    - reads a netcdf variable
	2. nc_varput    - writes to a netcdf variable
	3. nc_attget    - reads a netcdf attribute
	4. nc_attput    - writes a netcdf attribute
	5. nc_padheader - pads header section of large netCDF files
	6. nc_dump      - prints netcdf metadata

There is a subdirectory called "tests" which has routines that test
the m-files of SNCTOOLS.  You really don't need to worry about this
unless you are convinced that there is something wrong with one of
the m-files.  In that case, you can run the test suite by changing
directories into "tests" and running "test_snctools" from the matlab
command line.  


SNCTOOLS and OPeNDAP
=======================================================================
As of version 2.3.0, SNCTOOLS can use either of java or opendap-enabled
mexnc to read OPeNDAP URLs and local netCDF files.  In order to use 
java as the read-backend, follow these steps.

	First you have to have R14 or higher.

	Then download toolsUI-2.2.18.jar or higher from
	ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf-java/ 
	
	Make sure that you DO NOT start matlab with the -nojvm option.  
	
	Add this jar file to your dynamic java path from within matlab
	using javaaddpath, i.e.

		>> javaaddpath ( '/path/to/toolsUI-2.2.18.jar' );

	From the command line, you can then turn on the java backend with 

		>> setpref ( 'SNCTOOLS', 'USE_JAVA', true );


KNOWN ISSUES
=======================================================================

There will be varying degrees of difficulty in transitioning SNCTOOLS
to work with upcoming builds of mexnc/netcdf-4 (I won't even attempt
it with the netcdf toolbox).  Some m-files, like nc_varget, nc_varput,
nc_attget, nc_attput, and nc_dump will be getting a lot more attention
from me than others in this matter.
