% When computing the pseudo-inverse matrix using SVD, there is risk of 'SVD
% did not convergeâ€™ if the (HPH + R) matrix is ill conditioned. 
% A quick check would be to evaluate the condition number of the matrix:
% i.e., cond(HPH+R). If this is high (e.g., >100), it suggests the matrix 
% is ill-conditioned (or in other words the difference between the largest 
% and smallest singular values is huge). If that's the case, one solution 
% is to add a very small number to the diagonal to make the matrix invertible
% Doing so does not really affect the estimates and it helps the numerics.
%
% 'directinverse' option applies the slash operator (/), which is rather
% efficient and would give the same inverse of the matrix (same result as 'inv') through solving
% an overdetermined inverse problem and thus a least-squares solution is given.
% This is faster than svd method when the size of R is not too large (order of ~10e2)
% Do not use 'inv', which is least efficient in my tests.
