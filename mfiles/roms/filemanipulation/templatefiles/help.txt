(but do not need to be) used:

<<NP>>: will be replaced by the number of processors used for the job.
<<EXECUTABLE>>: will be replaced by the executable file.
<<INFILE>>: will be replaced by the input file that provides input to the 
    executable.
<<OUTFILE>>: will be replaced by the output or log file. 
<<QNAME>>: will be replaced by the name of the queue job.
<<STDOUT>>: will be replaced by name of the ROMS standard output file
<<STDERR>>: will be replaced by name of the ROMS standard error file
